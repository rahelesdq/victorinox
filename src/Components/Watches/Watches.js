            ​​​​​​​125 years ago, Karl Elsener didn’t just invent the Swiss Army
            Knife – he invented an attitude. To this day, this attitude inspires
            every single one of our products – including our watches. Our
            timepieces are made right here in Switzerland and will inspire you
            to realize that time having fun is never wasted.
